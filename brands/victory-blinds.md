## Target Audience

**2. New Parents / Growing Family**

### Psychographics

- **Values:** Home quality matters; investing in the home is investing in happiness and family
- **Aesthetic sensibility:** Modern, minimalist, or contemporary — they notice design details
- **Tech comfort:** Moderate to high — motorised blinds and smart home integration appeal to them
- **Social proof weight:** High — they look at what others are doing before deciding

### Emotional Drivers

**The "Before" Feeling:**
- Frustration with harsh afternoon light
- Feeling like the space is stuck in time / doesn't match their taste
- Anxiety about child safety or privacy
- Sense that small changes could make a big difference they're not capitalizing on

**The "After" Feeling:**
- Control and comfort in the space they've invested in
- Pride in a home that looks intentional and curated
- Relief that kids can actually sleep / privacy is maintained
- Confidence that they made the right choice on a visible, long-term purchase

**Key Emotional Moments:**
- Standing in a room at a certain time of day and thinking "this light is ruining this space"
- Seeing a friend or celebrity's home with beautiful blinds and thinking "we should do that"
- Walking past a child's room and realizing how quickly they've grown, wanting the space to grow with them
- Arriving at a Zoom meeting and realizing the light behind them looks bad

## Brand Voice & Tone

- **Adjectives:** Warm, practical, Australian, trustworthy, solution-focused
- **Not:** Corporate jargon, overly sales-y, or discount-obsessed
- **Signature:** Friendly expertise — we know blinds, we know Australian homes, we get your aesthetic
- **Tone:** Conversational but authoritative; inspiring but realistic; aspirational but grounded

**Example voice lines:**
- "Transform your space from 'meh' to 'wow'" (not "Buy premium blinds")
- "Let's fix your afternoon light problem" (speaks to the real pain)
- "Blackout blinds that actually look good" (solves the objection)

## Content Themes That Have Worked

(Based on historical data — update as you test)

- **Lifestyle transformation moments:** Before/after reels of rooms at specific times of day (2:30pm harsh light, 6am dark bedroom)
- **Relatable pain points:** "When the sun hits your desk at 3pm" / "Trying to keep baby on a sleep schedule with too much light"
- **Family moments:** Parent watching kid grow up, wanting the room to grow with them
- **Aesthetic inspiration:** "This look you've been pinning — here's how to make it real with blinds"
- **Solution-focused:** Quick problem/solution format (problem: screen glare, solution: motorised roller blind)
- **User testimonials:** Real customers showing their spaces and how it changed their day-to-day

## Content Themes to Avoid

(Avoid these directions)

- Heavy discounting or "cheap blinds" positioning
- Generic "home improvement" content (lacks the emotional specificity)
- Overly technical specifications without benefit context
- Aspirational homes that feel unrelatable
- Content that doesn't show the actual blinds or the space clearly

## Competitors

- **Sunscreen Co.:** Focus on outdoor blinds and shading; more "backyard" than "indoors"
- **Custom Blinds Australia:** Similar positioning but less attention to aesthetic/lifestyle
- **Blind Faith:** Higher price point, luxury aesthetic; different audience (more designer-focused)
- **Bunnings blinds (DIY option):** Convenience-focused, mass-market; lacks personalization
