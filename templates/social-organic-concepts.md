## Performance Context

[3-5 bullet points synthesizing what the top organic posts had in common this period — what performed well, what the audience engaged with most, what type of content (format, topic, tone) resonated]

Example:
- Posts that showed a transformation or before/after moment generated 3x engagement compared to product-focused posts
- Stories of relatable customer moments (someone using the blinds to solve a specific problem) outperformed lifestyle aspirational content
- Reels with natural motion (actually closing blinds, light changing) got 2.5x more video views than static carousels
- Audience responded most to posts about emotional benefits (peace, control, comfort) vs. feature lists

---

## Paid Creative Signals

[2-3 bullets describing what themes/creative hooks are working in paid campaigns that organic should test or amplify]

Example:
- The "specific moment in time" hook (your 2:30pm, bedtime in pitch darkness) significantly outperformed generic product messaging
- Loss-framing (what you're missing) was more effective than gain-framing (what you could have)
- Video/Reel format with actual product in motion outperformed static image ads by 30% in CTR
- Copy opening with a relatable frustration before presenting the solution drives 40% lower CPA

## Content Concepts

[Agent will generate 6-8 full concept blocks below. Each concept is a complete creative brief.]

### Concept 1: [Concept Name]

**Platform**: [Instagram Reels / Facebook Feed / Both]
**Format**: [Reel / Carousel / Single Image / Text Post]
**Timing**: [When to post — seasonal hook, day of week, time of day if relevant]

**The Emotional Entry Point**
[1-2 sentences describing the specific moment in the viewer's life this intercepts — a scene, not a demographic. This must be visceral and recognizable.]

Example: "A parent standing in their teenager's doorway at 7:45am, realizing the room has outgrown the bright cartoon posters from years ago, but the morning light is still flooding in the same way. They feel the tension between 'they're growing up' and 'their space feels frozen in time.'"

**The Narrative Arc**
[What the content shows/says — beat by beat]

For Reels:
- Opening shot: [visual, timing]
- Development: [next beats, what unfolds]
- Reveal: [the moment of realization or solution]

For Carousel:
- Slide 1 (hook): [visual + text premise]
- Slide 2-4 (development): [what unfolds, problem/solution shown]
- Slide 5 (resolution): [the transformation or key insight]

For Static:
[The single visual truth the image captures — one perfect moment]

**Visual Direction**
[Shot-by-shot or specific image description. Lighting (warm/cool, time of day, intensity). Colour temperature. Subject positioning. What is in sharp focus vs. blurred. What is notably absent from frame. Any specific colours, textures, or environmental details.]

Example: "Tight shot of a hand (could be any age parent) reaching to adjust a motorised blind control — the hand is slightly blurred, blind slat is sharp. Afternoon light streams through the gap at a specific angle, casting shadow lines across a bookshelf of teenage novels and remnants of childhood books. The room has grown — it's no longer decorated for a small child, but the light control hasn't evolved with it. Warm golden-hour light, 3:15pm feel. Minimalist frame — nothing distracting, focus entirely on the moment of adjustment."

**Caption — Opening Line (verbatim)**
"[Write the actual first 1-2 lines of copy exactly as they should appear on platform]"

Example: "Your teenager's room is growing up. But the light? Still stuck at age 7."

**Caption — Full Direction**
[Tone, structure, length, any specific phrases or hooks. Not the full caption — the brief for writing it.]

Example: "Conversational, slightly bittersweet. Structure: open with the observation, pivot to the irony (they've grown, the light control hasn't), then address the solution. Include a moment of relief/recognition. Length: 80-120 words. Avoid 'imagine' or clichéd nostalgia language. Finish with a question that invites DMs or comments about their own experience ('How many rooms in your house have this problem?')."

**Why This Works**
[2-3 sentences grounding the concept in the audience insight and the specific psychological mechanism. Connect to paid data if applicable.]

Example: "This concept works because it names a specific growth moment many parents experience (their kid is literally growing up) and links it to a tangible, solvable problem (light control that didn't evolve with the child). The opening line doesn't ask them to imagine — it states an observation they recognize. It activates the loss-framing we've seen work in paid: 'you're missing something good (a room that fits your kid now).' The focus on the hand/adjustment gesture (not the product) makes it relatable — anyone can see themselves making this small change."

**Engagement Hook**
[The question, prompt, or device at the end of the caption that generates comments]

Example: "Drop a 🙌 if you're still managing light in a room decorated for a different age."

**Call to Action**
[Specific CTA — link in bio, DM, tag someone, shop now, etc. Should feel organic, not hard-sell]

Example: "DM us photos of rooms that need to grow with your family — we'll show you what's possible."
