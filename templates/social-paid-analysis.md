## Creative Performance

**Score: [X]/10**

### Top Performers

| Ad | Format | Spend | CPA | CTR | Key Hook |
|----|--------|-------|-----|-----|----------|
| [name] | [Image/Video/Carousel] | $[X] | $[X] | [X]% | "[Opening line of copy]" |
| [name] | [Format] | $[X] | $[X] | [X]% | "[Hook]" |
| [name] | [Format] | $[X] | $[X] | [X]% | "[Hook]" |

### Bottom Performers

| Ad | Format | Spend | CPA | CTR | What's Not Working |
|----|--------|-------|-----|-----|--------------------|
| [name] | [Image/Video/Carousel] | $[X] | $[X] | [X]% | [Specific element: e.g., "Opening copy is too product-focused", "Format doesn't match objective"] |
| [name] | [Format] | $[X] | $[X] | [X]% | [Element] |
| [name] | [Format] | $[X] | $[X] | [X]% | [Element] |

### Creative Intelligence

[2-3 paragraphs analyzing the pattern that distinguishes top from bottom performers. This is the core insight — not just "this ad is more engaging" but a specific psychological or structural mechanism.

Example: "The top three performers all open with a specific outcome or moment ('Your 2:30pm used to look like this') which activates loss-framing — the viewer imagines what they are missing right now, rather than what they could gain by purchasing. The bottom three all open with product features ('Premium motorised roller blinds') which requires more cognitive effort from a scrolling user and doesn't immediately trigger an emotional response. The winning pattern names a specific pain point (afternoon glare at a particular time) before presenting the solution, which is more persuasive than leading with the product itself."]

### Creative Hypothesis

**[One-sentence testable principle derived from the data]**

Example: "Ads that open with a specific negative moment (time of day, light condition) will outperform ads that open with product features by at least 30% in CTR."
